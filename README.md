## What is it?

A multiplayer game using LiveView and Tailwind written in Elixir with Phoenix to connect mutiple players at same game.

This repository started to think of separations of concerns in modern functional programming.
It was also a Hook investigation. This version got rid of `<canvas>` tag to use modern Liveview.
This is a study repo and long term wip! Slowly but always improving.

## How to play

The game is a simple game where you are a rat üê≠ running for your food!
Get it before your opponets, the ants üêú.

## How to run it locally

This app uses `.tools-version` and recommend using ASDF to install. Check guide bellow.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Install ESBuild `mix esbuild.install`
- Generate assets `mix assets.deploy`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
